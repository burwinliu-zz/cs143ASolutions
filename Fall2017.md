# Fall 2017
# Question 1
> Topic: Basic Page Tables
## Part A
### Question
 (10 points) Illustrate the page table used by xv6 to map the kernel into the virtual address
space of each process (draw a page table diagram and explain the page table entries).
Specifically concentrate on one entry: the entry responsible for the translation of the first
page of the kernel. Keep in mind that xv6 maps the kernel into the virtual address range
starting above the second gigabyte of virtual memory. Note, that after xv6 is done booting,
it xv6 uses normal 4KB, 32bit, 2-level page tables. You also have to recall the physicall
address of the first kernel page (look at the boot lecture or the kernel map), and the virtual
address where this page is mapped. To make the example realistic, don’t forget that xv6
allocates memory for it’s page table directory and page tables from the kernel memory
allocator.

# Question 2
> Topic: Xv6 shell

Alice works on implementing a new shell for xv6. She implements a pipe command (e.g., ls |
wc) like this:
<pre>
void
runcmd(struct cmd *cmd)
{
    ...
    switch(cmd->type){
        default:
            fprintf(stderr, "unknown runcmd\n");
            exit(-1);
        case ’|’: pcmd = (struct pipecmd*)cmd;
            int p[2];
            pipe(p);
            int pid = fork();
            if(pid == 0){
                //child process:left side
                close(1);
                dup(p[1]);
                close(p[1]);
                close(p[0]);
                runcmd(pcmd->left);
            }
            close(0);
            dup(p[0]);
            close(p[0]);
            close(p[1]);
            wait(NULL);
            runcmd(pcmd->right);
            break;
        }
    ...
}

</pre>
## Part A
### Question
(5 points) Her implementation always waits for left side to finish, but she is not sure if it’s
correct since she notices that the shell that xv6 implements (sh.c in the xv6 source tree)
launches the right side right away. Can you come up with an example for which Alice’s
shell fails, while the xv6’s is still correct? Explain your answer.

# Question 3
> Topic: OS isolation and protection
  
## Part A
### Question
(5 points) Explain the organization and memory layout of the xv6 process. Draw a diagram. Explain which protection bits are set by the kernel and explain why kernel does
it.
### Solution
TODO
  
## Part B
### Question
(5 points) In xv6 individual processes are isolated, specifically they cannot access each
others memory. Explain how this is implemented.
### Solution

## Question 4
> Topic: OS Organization
  
### Part A
#### Question
(10 points) KERNBASE limits the amount of memory a single process can use, which might
be irritating on a machine with a full 4 GB of RAM. Would raising KERNBASE allow a
process to use more memory (explain your answer)
