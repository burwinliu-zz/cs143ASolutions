# Fall 2018
# Question 1
Xv6 shell implements a pipe command (e.g., ls | wc) with the following code:
<pre>
8650 case PIPE:
8651    pcmd = (struct pipecmd*)cmd;
8652    if(pipe(p) < 0)
8653        panic("pipe");
        // Point A
8654    if(fork1() == 0){
8655        close(1);
8656        dup(p[1]);
8657        close(p[0]);
8658        close(p[1]);
        // point B
8659        runcmd(pcmd>left);
8660    }
8661    if(fork1() == 0){
8662        close(0);
8663        dup(p[0]);
8664        close(p[0]);
8665        close(p[1]);
8666        runcmd(pcmd>right);
8667    }
8668    close(p[0]);
8669    close(p[1]);
        // point C
8670    wait();
8671    wait();
8672    break
</pre>
Draw the connections between file descriptors, I/O devices and pipes at points A, B above.
Connections can be depicted with lines with arrows. The error is aligned with the direction of
data flow, i.e., if the file is written the error points at the file object.
Hint: pay attention to close() dup() calls before and after the point

# Question 2
> Topic: Processes and system calls
## Part A
### Problem
(5 points) What is the first system call executed by xv6? Explain your answer.
### Solution
exec(). It’s executed by the first process that uses a simple assembly sequence to simply
invoke exec() with the arguments needed to reload its address space with the “init” process.

# Quesiton 3
> Topic: Int and Context Switches
## Part A
### Problem
(5 points) When a user-program (a program that executes at current privilege level 3) is
preempted with an interrupt five registers are saved by the hardware: ESP, SS, EFLAGS,
CS, EIP. Why these five registers have to be saved, but others, e.g., EAX, ECX, etc.,
don’t?
### Solution

These five change right away, e.g., SS and ESP is changed to point to the kernel stack,
EIP is changed to point to the interrupt handler entry, CS is changed to CS with privilege
level 0, EFLAGS might be changed too since some interrupt handlers are configured to
disable subsequent interrupts, etc. 

## Part B
### Problem
(5 points) During the context switch the code of the swtch() function visibly does not
save the EIP register. How is it saved and restored then during the context switch?
### Solution
It is saved on the stack as the ret addr when swtch is called, so on return, when ret is called, it is popped off the stack and into EIP as a standard ret

## Part C
### Problem
(5 points) The fork() system call returns “0” inside the child process. This return value
is passed to the child process from inside the fork() system call with the following line:  
np->tf->eax = 0  
Explain how does this work, i.e., how the “0” value ends up being returned by the fork()
inside the user process.

### Solution
By convention, eax holds the return addr, so when you input into the trapframe (which will be "restored") to be the value of the new processes trapframe at eax, when it returns, it will return value 0

## Part D
### Problem
(5 points) What does the stack look inside the bar() function. Draw a diagram, provide
a short description for every value on the stack.
<pre>
int bar(int a, void *buffer, int size) {
        // magic
};

</pre>
### Solution

<pre>
---------------------------- |
        size                 | stack grows this way
---------------------------- v
        buffer
----------------------------
        a
----------------------------
        return address
----------------------------
        old ebp
----------------------------
        possibly local variables
        and spilled registers
----------------------------
</pre>

# Quesiton 4
> Topic: File system

Xv6 lays out the file system on disk as follows:
![Table Image](../img/W2017Final_Aqs.png)

## Part A
### Problem
(5 points) Every file system transaction that changes the file system write one disk block
twice. What is this block (what’s its block number) and why is it written twice?


### Solution
Block 2 is written twice as it contains the log header. First it is written to commit the log
and then it is written to mark the log as clear (after transactions are installed)


# Quesiton 5
> Topic: File system

## Part A
### Problem
(5 points) Sleep has to check lk != &ptable.lock to avoid a deadlock. Suppose the
special case when the following lines
<pre>
if(lk != &ptable.lock) {
        acquire(&ptable.lock);
        release(lk);
}
</pre>
are replaced with
<pre>
        release(lk);
        acquire(&ptable.lock);
</pre>
Doing this would break sleep. How?
